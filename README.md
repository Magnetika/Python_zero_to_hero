+# Python Zero to Hero
+
+A compact, beginner-friendly collection of Python exercises and examples organized as short, numbered scripts. This repository is intended as a study/course notebook you can run locally to learn core Python concepts step by step.
+
+**Contents**
+
+- `01/` — Basics: `print`, integers, floats, arithmetic
+- `02/` — Variables, immutability, strings, input and formatting
+- `03/` — Lists and loops
+- `04/` — Conditionals and loops
+- `05/` — Slicing, comprehensions and unpacking
+- `06/` — Functions, return values and scope
+- `07/` — Simple algorithms: min/max, sum, search, bubble sort
+- `08/` — Tuples and sets
+- `09/` — Dictionaries and CRUD operations
+- `10/` — Modules and standard library examples (random, date)
+- `11/` — Misc / additional topics
+- `12/` — Project / `main.py` examples
+
+**Getting started**
+
+- Requirements: Python 3.8+ recommended.
+- Run a single lesson file, for example:
+
+```
+python 01/01_print_function.py
+```
+
+- You can open the repository in your editor (VS Code, PyCharm) and run or step through files.
+
+**Notes**
+
+- Files are intentionally short and focused — they are safe to read and run locally.
+- No dependencies beyond the Python standard library are required for the examples in this repository.
